# CCI-A3

Data surrounding an Instagram page’s engagement during the month of July was imported and manipulated to plot a colour-encoded matrix that revealed general patterns in their dataset. The final heatmap displays data from Instagram that identifies the best time of the day and day of the week to run social media marketing campaigns. 

As seen in the heatmap, the best time of the day and day of the week for Instagram engagement is on Tuesdays around 22:00, and the worst times are between 2:00 and 6:00. These results are surprising, however due to the large percentage of our Instagram followers being American the information is valid and incredibly helpful. Whilst the artefact is complete and largely working, I was unable to remove the first colour-bar on the left without also removing the ‘Likes’ label. Additionally, the y-axis scale is not linear. Whilst this interrupts how the heatmap reads, one can still understand the data and visualise trends. 

By importing and manipulating a plain-text .csv file, the code utilised the above packages to organise complex data into an easy-to-read heatmap.
